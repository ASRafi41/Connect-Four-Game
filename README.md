# Connect-Four-Game

This is a C++ implementation of the classic Connect Four game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning.

# How-to-Play
1) Goal: Align four pieces (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) before the AI.
2) You: Represented by O. AI: Represented by X.
3) Turns: Players alternate placing pieces in a 7-column grid.
4) Win/Draw: First to align four wins; full board without a winner results in a draw.
